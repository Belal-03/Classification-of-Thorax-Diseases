# X-rAI: Classification of Thorax Diseases 

## 🧠 Project Overview

**X-rAI** addresses the critical challenge of diagnosing thoracic diseases through chest X-rays by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility in healthcare.

The global shortage of specialized radiologists, along with the time-consuming and error-prone nature of manual diagnoses, highlights the need for an automated solution. This project employs a deep learning approach using a pre-trained **ResNet50** model to classify **13 thoracic diseases** from chest X-ray images.

The methodology includes:

- Accurate data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Training on the NIH Chest X-ray dataset  
- Deployment on a user-friendly web platform

## 📊 Key Results

- **AUC:** 0.9609  
- **Precision:** 0.8347  
- **Recall:** 0.7929  
- **Prediction Time:** < 1 second

The system significantly reduces radiologists’ workload by providing quick diagnostic probabilities and enhancing patient outcomes.
